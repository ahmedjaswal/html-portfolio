<h1>The Best Movies According to Ahmed Jaswal</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Rated Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>The series as a whole is simply enchanting for fiction.</p>
<h3>Forest of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>Filled with a sense of nostalgia and nonchalant character bulding.</p>
<h3>Lord of the rings</h3>
<p>The world is devided into those of have seen/read it and those who have not.</p>
